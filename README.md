This is the the summary of AI usage

As AI useage is allowed in this final exam, I briefly used AI tools such as ChatPGT to help me finishing some tasks and answering some question I do not understand.
1. In Section 1, I wantted to boost everything up considering there is a 3 hour limitation. Hence, I prompted GPT to generate a formal HTML stracture for me.
2. In Section 1, I was not so sure the dimension configuration to adpat different devices. Therefore, I ask GPT: what is the most common pixel to enter in my css in order to meet the requirement? I was given 600px and 900px to fit both tablet and mobiles.
3. In Section 1, while mannualy finishing the first task, I pasted my work and asked AI to double check if there were anything to improve. I was told to add a jump-to-main button for accessibility improvement. I rejected this advice as I found not necessary in this case. Besides, I will not function properly without decinated CSS added.
4. In section 2, I asked GPT about the most common types of plugins people utilising in this decade. I was listed many, then select the most useful one, which is the payment security plugins.
5. In section 3, due to I cannot repeat a JSON format properly, I asked AI to mock up one for me. I then modified it accodring to those endpoints I answered.
6. I do not have much experience of debugging, so I ask GPT the most common methods of webpage design debugging. I was given a big chunk of context that I have to read and extract the most useful advice to answer Section 4 part a's questions.
7. I did exactly the same thing as 6. I did not dive very deep into bootstrap and Tailwind CSSï¼Œ therefore I asked AI to introduce them to me, and what are theire pros and cons comparing to each others.
