## Architecture Analysis
The big difference comes down to flexibility and complexity. Both systems let non-tech staff use the familiar WordPress dashboard to create content - that part stays the same whether you're going headless or not. Where things get tricky is the frontend. With headless, you're essentially splitting the website's brain (backend) from its face (frontend). This means developers can build the storefronts separately using modern tools like React or Vue - great for when you need different interfaces for web, mobile, and in-store screens. But it's more work since you're maintaining multiple frontends instead of one unified system.

Cost-wise, traditional WordPress wins for simplicity. You just need one standard server to run it. Headless gets pricier because you'll likely need separate setups for the content backend plus each frontend platform. That said, headless pays off long-term if you're scaling up - it's built like modern apps, grows cleaner, and keeps your branding consistent everywhere.

For bakery's specific needs - pushing the same specials to website, app, and digital menus while keeping things future-proof - headless makes more sense. It gives you that central content hub while letting each platform show it in the best way possible, no double-handling required.
** Recommendation
Use Headless WordPress. It allows:
1. Flexible, modern frontend tech like React/Next.js for mobile/web (Week 11: Wordpress and React)
2. Separate teams to build platforms in parallel (Week 10: Wordpress REST and Headless CMS)
3. Centralized content storage (Week 7: CMS Fundamentals)
4. Easy integration with real-time POS updates (by APIs)(Week 11: Wordpress and React)

## API Design Strategy
Assuming what a bakery business might need in their CMS content, here is the API endpoint I came up:
1. /api/menu. It will use GET method do fetch all menu items.
2. /api/menu{store_id}. It also uses GET to fetch a specific stroe meanu.
3. /api/latest. This endpoint uses POST method, it allows manager to update real-time stock from POS.
4. /api/meanu/{product_id}. This endpoint uses PATCH method to query, or modify item status like price, or availability.
## Example JSON Response:
{
  "store_id": "WA001",
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "latte01",
      "name": "Latte",
      "price": 4.50,
      "available": true,
      "category": "Hot_Coffee"
    }
  ]
}
## Client Adaption
The access control setup varies by user type: public visitors (web/app) get rate-limited API keys, in-store devices use JWT tokens for secure syncs, and admins log in via OAuth2. This layered approach keeps each platform secure â€“ protecting sensitive actions like inventory updates while supporting seamless scaling.

## Cross platform Consistency
In order to fulfill this, it is recommended to create content fields with flags (Week 10: Wordpress REST and Headless CMS). Also, (Week 10: Benefits of destructing operator in React) it is necessary to store flex variable such as price and availability using dynamic API.
