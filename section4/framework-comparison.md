Framework Decision Matrix

To build a multi-location restaurant management dashboard, I compared the following front-end frameworks:

## Bootstrap
- **Pros:**
  - Fast prototyping with built-in components
  - Extensive documentation and browser support
- **Cons:**
  - Limited customization without overriding styles
  - Can lead to inconsistent UI when custom styling is layered

## Tailwind CSS
- **Pros:**
  - Highly customizable through utility-first classes
  - Encourages consistent spacing and design through atomic approach
- **Cons:**
  - Steeper learning curve for teams unfamiliar with utility CSS
  - Risk of inconsistent class usage without team discipline

## Material-UI (React UI Library)
- **Pros:**
  - Provides accessible, themeable React components
  - Integrates directly with React, enabling rapid development
  - Promotes design consistency aligned with Material Design standards
- **Cons:**
  - Some performance overhead if components are not tree-shaken
  - Requires theme overrides for more branded styling

## Recommendation: Material-UI
- Combines the speed of prebuilt components with flexibility for custom themes
- Offers strong alignment with React and promotes modular design
- Supports accessibility out of the box and reduces design debt
- Ideal for:
  - Managing complex UIs like inventory tables, staff scheduling, and sales dashboards
  - Scaling across teams using a shared component and theme system

## Implementation Strategy
- Set up a central **custom MUI theme** to define:
  - Typography, color palette, spacing tokens
- Develop reusable modules:
  - Example: `<InventoryPanel />`, `<SalesGraph />`, `<ScheduleBoard />`
- Use **Storybook** for documenting UI components and promoting reuse

# Design System Strategy (4 marks)

To ensure design consistency across the dashboard, the following strategies will be applied:

## Component reusability standards
- Establish a shared UI component library (`/components/ui`)
- Use prop-driven, atomic components (e.g., Button, Card, TableCell)
- Promote DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) principles by extracting repeated UI patterns
- Apply consistent naming conventions and TypeScript typings for props

## Colour scheme and typography decisions for data-heavy interfaces
- Adopt a limited, accessible color palette:
  - Green for positive values
  - Red for issues or alerts
  - Grey for neutral UI elements
- Use a readable type scale:
  - Base font: 16px
  - Emphasize headers and KPIs with bolder/larger font weights
  - Monospaced font for numerical data in tables

## Responsive design approach for desktop-focused application
- Prioritize large screen layouts using a 12-column grid system
- Design for common breakpoints (e.g. given by AI, md: 960px, lg: 1280px, xl: 1440px)
- Use collapsible sidebars and resizable panels for optimal desktop UX
- Ensure all layouts are accessible via keyboard navigation and visible focus indicators

## Documentation strategy for team collaboration
- Use Storybook to document reusable components with live examples and usage notes
- Maintain a `design-system.md` guide in the repo for color, typography, and layout rules
- Apply JSDoc or TypeScript annotations to explain props and usage patterns
- Host regular design sync meetings to review new components and enforce consistency
